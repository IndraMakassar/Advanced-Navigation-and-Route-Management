# navigation

A simple Flutter project on navigation.

## Getting Started
this application is just a barebore app with the intention on learning navigation in flutter. 

the first screen or home you could navigate to the second or third screen using the elevated button in the middle of the 
screen, or you could use the drawer by tapping the hamburger on top left and tap the list.

on the second screen you could navigate to the first screen by using the elevated button in the middle, or you could use
the drawer to navigate to the first or third screen.

the third screen is almost the same as the second screen with the exception of the drawer could only navigate you to the
first and second screen.
